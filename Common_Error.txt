- Not showing anything
 -> Possible minimized scale due to inches. Check Configure -> Unit Setup -> System Unit Setup
- Cannot export .visual
 -> Go to Customize -> Config System Paths -> 3rd Party Plugin -> add the /bigword/tools/exporter/version from BigWorld 2.1
- Not valid material link: (absolule link to .png making export failure)
 -> Rendering -> Material Editor -> Photometric/Bitmap Path -> Strip All Paths 
- Crash upon F5/Entering with no log
 Possible missing hardpoint (HP). Check HP_gunJoint in turret, etc.
 
- Animate antenna:
 + Create two bones @ root and tip (Create -> System -> Bones IK chain). Can create multiple bones, but should only assign those two to the mesh
 + Select all antenna vertices; Modifier List -> Skin. Add the two bones to the mesh.
 + While still selecting all vertices, select Edit Envelope (or expandable Skin->Envelop)
 + Adjust the root bone so the outer envelope cover the whole antenna; long-press falloff (third button in Envelope Properties) and select quick falloff
 + Adjust the tip bone, also use the outer envelope on the whole antenna, long-press falloff and either use linear or quick falloff. Quick is more conservative; Linear introduce some sort of "bounce" on the lower section.
 + NOTE: Make sure to change the fx to the skinned version when copying material from original
 
Making SWF:
Compile the python binding with compileall
C:\Python27\python.exe -m compileall py\mod_UML_interface.py

Compile the swf, with its external swc(s) are found in gui-part1/2.pkg; stand in `as3` folder
D:\Archive\flex_sdk_4.6.0.23201B\bin\mxmlc  -compiler.source-path=as3 -compiler.external-library-path+=as3\lib\common-1.0-SNAPSHOT.swc,as3\lib\gui_base-1.0-SNAPSHOT.swc -static-link-runtime-shared-libraries=true -o as3\UML_MainGUI.swf as3\uml\UML_MainGUI.as
..\flex_sdk_4.6.0.23201B\bin\mxmlc.bat  -compiler.source-path=as3 -compiler.external-library-path+=as3\lib\common-1.0-SNAPSHOT.swc,as3\lib\gui_base-1.0-SNAPSHOT.swc -static-link-runtime-shared-libraries=true -o as3\UML_MainGUI.swf as3\uml\UML_MainGUI.as
If installed in Windows 64bit, consider using the mxmlc.bat trick if encountering "Could not find JVM". Content of it should be:
"""
@echo off
for  %%i in (%0) do set FLEX_HOME=%%~dpi..
java -jar "%FLEX_HOME%\lib\mxmlc.jar" +flexlib="%FLEX_HOME%/frameworks" %*
"""

Those swc can also be viewed using JPEXS Free Flash Decompiler

Binding between swf and python classes are achieved with:
g_entitiesFactories.addSettings(ViewSettings("UML_MainGUI", UML_MainGUI, 'UML_MainGUI.swf',
						WindowLayer.WINDOW, None, ScopeTemplates.GLOBAL_SCOPE, isModal=True, canClose=True, canDrag=False))

Currently only swf can call python function; creating GUI objects must use App.utils.classFactory.getClass. NOTE: can use getClassName instead of searching for this crap
DropdownMenu -> DropdownMenuUI
SoundButtonEx -> ButtonNormal

Use ScrollingListPx instead of ScrollingListEx;

The game reload the swf after battle; so you can replace and test things quick on the flash front; simply replace the file, play a battle, and the changes will be updated.

GIMP:
Edit separate channels by Color -> Components -> Decompose, choose RGBA, edit the other image as you please, then Recompose.
AO map:
- R is decal exclusion map. White will not receive decals.
- G is Ambient Occlusion, ie shadow from global illumination. White will receive propotionally less shadow than black
- B is mud exclusion map. White will not receive mud.
- A is camouflage exclusion map. Black will not receive camo.
