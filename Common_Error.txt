- Not showing anything
 -> Possible minimized scale due to inches. Check Configure -> Unit Setup -> System Unit Setup
- Cannot export .visual
 -> Go to Customize -> Config System Paths -> 3rd Party Plugin -> add the /bigworld/tools/exporter/version from BigWorld 2.1
- Not valid material link: (absolule link to .png making export failure)
 -> Rendering -> Material Editor -> Photometric/Bitmap Path -> Strip All Paths 
- Crash upon F5/Entering with no log
 Possible missing hardpoint (HP). Check HP_gunJoint in turret, etc.
 
- Blank camo on turret/hull/etc.
Issue caused by texture larger than camo appliance size (aoTextureSize field); resize it to correct level. 
 
- Editing UV mapping using .ms script: 
After scaling, resize corresponding dds (AM, AMM, AO, GMM) to the ratio you want. E.g if you resized to 4x4, every images should be topleft 1x1 of the new images' 4x4

- Weird shade?
Currently fixed by removing normal map. See below for possible fix

- Animate antenna:
 + Create two bones @ root and tip (Create -> System -> Bones IK chain). Can create multiple bones, but should only assign those two to the mesh
 + Select all antenna vertices; Modifier List -> Skin. Add the two bones to the mesh.
 + While still selecting all vertices, select Edit Envelope (or expandable Skin->Envelop)
 + Adjust the root bone so the outer envelope cover the whole antenna; long-press falloff (third button in Envelope Properties) and select quick falloff
 + Adjust the tip bone, also use the outer envelope on the whole antenna, long-press falloff and either use linear or quick falloff. Quick is more conservative; Linear introduce some sort of "bounce" on the lower section.
 + NOTE: Make sure to change the fx to the skinned version when copying material from original

- Pivoting tilted 3D objects (for miniturrets, autorotors, etc.).
 + Create a Working pivot, and align it manually until you can turn the objects using that pivot
 + Go into Edit Working Pivot and turn on MAXScript Listener
 + Retrieve orientation and location of it (the currently selected Working Pivot) using `quatToEuler2 $.transform.rotation` and `$.pos`
 + Select the object, set to Affect Pivot only, and copy these params down on the object Pivot

 
Making SWF:
Compile the python binding with compileall
C:\Python27\python.exe -m compileall mod_UML_interface.py
Additionally, to pack into independent .wotmod
py pyc_to_wotmod.py mod_replaceOwnCustomization.pyc

Compile the swf, with its external swc(s) are found in gui-part1/2.pkg; stand in `root` folder (you should see the `as3` folder)
D:\Archive\flex_sdk_4.6.0.23201B\bin\mxmlc  -compiler.source-path=as3 -compiler.external-library-path+=as3\lib\common-1.0-SNAPSHOT.swc,as3\lib\gui_base-1.0-SNAPSHOT.swc -static-link-runtime-shared-libraries=true -o as3\UML_MainGUI.swf as3\uml\UML_MainGUI.as
..\flex_sdk_4.6.0.23201B\bin\mxmlc.bat  -compiler.source-path=as3 -compiler.external-library-path+=as3\lib\common-1.0-SNAPSHOT.swc,as3\lib\gui_base-1.0-SNAPSHOT.swc -static-link-runtime-shared-libraries=true -o as3\UML_MainGUI.swf as3\uml\UML_MainGUI.as
If installed in Windows 64bit, consider using the mxmlc.bat trick if encountering "Could not find JVM". Content of it should be:
"""
@echo off
for  %%i in (%0) do set FLEX_HOME=%%~dpi..
java -jar "%FLEX_HOME%\lib\mxmlc.jar" +flexlib="%FLEX_HOME%/frameworks" %*
"""

Those swc can also be viewed using JPEXS Free Flash Decompiler

Binding between swf and python classes are achieved with:
g_entitiesFactories.addSettings(ViewSettings("UML_MainGUI", UML_MainGUI, 'UML_MainGUI.swf',
						WindowLayer.WINDOW, None, ScopeTemplates.GLOBAL_SCOPE, isModal=True, canClose=True, canDrag=False))

Currently only swf can call python function; creating GUI objects must use App.utils.classFactory.getClass. NOTE: can use getClassName instead of searching for this crap
DropdownMenu -> DropdownMenuUI
SoundButtonEx -> ButtonNormal

Use ScrollingListPx instead of ScrollingListEx;

The game reload the swf after battle; so you can replace and test things quick on the flash front; simply replace the file, play a battle, and the changes will be updated.

GIMP:
Edit separate channels by Color -> Components -> Decompose, choose RGBA, edit the other image as you please, then Recompose.
AO map:
- R is decal exclusion map. White will not receive decals.
- G is Ambient Occlusion, ie shadow from global illumination. White will receive propotionally less shadow than black
- B is mud exclusion map. White will not receive mud.
- A is camouflage exclusion map. Black will not receive camo.

GMM map:
- R is gloss map - white will be more reflective (white is glass-like)
- G is metallic map - white will look more like bare metal
- B is paint exclusion map. Black will not receive paint

How to do fading:
- Have unfaded
- Add Layer Mask, (recommend to do full transparency)
- Noise -> Plasma, change seed + turbulence until the regions look fine
- Color -> Curve, reorganize as wanted
- If want to copy one mask to another, do Layer to Selection, then Add Layer Mask with "Selection" option

OTHER:
Soviet sticker: 15924, 15872, 15877 looks great; 15926 is a plain, faded white star
Vietnam sticker: 410 is flag, 38 is armored flag

Prefered camos:
513, 512, 514 (large spots); 555, 554, 556 (7th aniv); 634, 635, 636 (Expeditionary)
	Summer independent: 638 (Homeland), 660 (1st Guard), 576 (Fire Bulge), 
	Winter independent: 635 (Glass), 623 (Alfa), 622 (Btl Moscow), 598 (Hunt Silver), 560 (Western Front), 387 (Black Marble)
	Desert independent: 618 (Thanksgiving), 553 (Four tone floral), 299 (Lancelot)
